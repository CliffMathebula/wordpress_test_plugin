e. In words, pseudo code or using language of your choice, explain how you would write a function that
writes away user name and email to a database


Using PHP
First thing is to create a connetion file while will come with servername, username, password, and database name
eg:
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "database_name";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername,
$username, $password, $dbname);

The the following step is to create a function which will include the connection file:
eg:
function insert(){
include('conn.php');
// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
die("Connection failed: "
. $conn->connect_error);
}

$sqlquery = "INSERT INTO table VALUES('John', 'john@example.com')"

if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
echo "record inserted successfully";
} else {
echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
}
}
